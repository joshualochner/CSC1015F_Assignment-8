# CSC1015F_Assignment-8
This assignment involves constructing Python functions that use recursion. You must not use loop constructs (such as ‘for’ and ‘while’) in your solutions. There are four questions. The first concerns identifying palindromes, the second two concern constructing a module containing pattern matching functions. The last concerns the identification of palindromic prime numbers.
